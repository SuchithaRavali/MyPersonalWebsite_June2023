            I played a major role in simulating Gas Turbine and Steam Turbines, where I work mainly
            on creating Easy5 Python Models for Gas Turbine, Steam Turbine, Generator and models
            for the auxiliaries; creating a simulation platform in Unity; running the simulation and
            validating Gas Turbine and Steam Turbine operation using the software till it reaches the
            base load. These models represent the plant and the unit’s behavior. I worked on various
            turbine frame sizes like 6B, 6F, 7FA, 7FB, 9F, 9H and many more. Calculated various
            engineering parameters like pressures, temperatures, so on and created models for Steam
            Turbine using thegenerated data while running the plant. Validated the performance of
            pressure, temperature, level and flow sensors. <br>
            Tools used: Easy5, Unity, Virtual Controller, MATLAB, ControlST.

            I used the M.S. Visio software for creating Network Topology drawings.
            Network Topology drawings primarily shows the DCS connections of various instruments in
            a thermal Power Plant. The Network drawings are a pictorial representation of how all the
            DCS equipment are connected in the plant field. Defined appropriate switch models suitable
            for the need, gathered the switches data, analyzed and processed.<br>
            Tools Used: M.S.Visio, ControlST, ACME.

            I worked in creating Modkit drawings. The Modkit drawings are created to show the
            updated customer requirements. Analyzed customer data, suggested improvements, designed
            Mod drawings, prepared a field Modification Instructions, reviewed the markups, added an
            Engineering Change number and much more. This activity involves creating a timing
            estimate of the parts required to be shipped to the sites as per their design specifications.<br>
            Tools Used: M.S.Visio, ACME, AutoCAD, Active point HMI cleanup.

        <h3> Academic Projects: </h3>
        <p>
            <em>1.“Polygraph Test Using MATLAB”</em><br>
                Brief Overview: The main objective of the project is to design a polygraph to measure Galvanic
                Skin Resistance (GSR), blood pressure, breathing rate and the deviation of the subject’s voice from the fundamental frequency with the intent of distinguishing truth from lying.<br>
                <br>
            <em>2.“Digital Design Using FINFets”</em><br>
                Brief Overview: The reduction of transistor dimensions is essential to increase the performance
                while the active area of integrated circuits is reduced. My project aims at doing this and proposes FINFet technology to suit this requirement.
